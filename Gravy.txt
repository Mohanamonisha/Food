Muttoncurry
###########
This is a mutton curry recipe without tomatoes. 
It is No Fuss mutton curry. 
The magic lies in homemade meat masala and gheeâ€¦ this mutton curry is definitely not for the faint hearted. 
It is cooked in loads ghee / oil. And thats how mutton is ideally cooked. 
But this is by far the simplest mutton curry I have ever come across. 
Just put everything together and let the pressure cooker do its work. 
This mutton curry has a unique silky texture. It tastes yum with homemade tandoori roti, cut onions and green chilly. 
This mutton curry requires no Bhunoing (sauteing) and thats a blessing.
