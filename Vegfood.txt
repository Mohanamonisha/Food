India is a big country with many states and regions. 
Each region   offers a unique assortment of dishes and cooking techniques. 
Each regional cuisine uses its own locally grown herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables. 
These regional cuisines collectively combined together form the very delightful Indian Cuisine.
